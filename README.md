# PREDICT453_CaseStudy2
A place to put code and other material used in Case Study 2 from Cohort 8 of PREDICT 453 with Dr. Maren.  Additionally, some code reflects individual case study projects completed as well during the Spring 2017 session of PREDICT 453.  Although the underlying data may be different for certain instances of code, they are all dealing with some form of text analytics.

# DSI
This is a directory where all of the .txt versions of the DSI's in the full corpus live.  Currently, this is only missing DSI 38 and DSI 40.

# RTV
The RTV file now includes both noun phrases from Cohort 7, added noun phrases from Cohort 8 (our cohort) as well as equivalent terms proposed for each EC.

# Note
This isn't an official thing, it's just something I created to keep track of what I was using and make it easier to share. :) . Thanks for looking!
